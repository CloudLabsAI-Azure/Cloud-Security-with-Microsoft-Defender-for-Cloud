## Task 1: Understanding CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are critical practices in modern software development, enabling teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. Azure DevOps provides a robust platform to implement CI/CD pipelines. Hereâ€™s a basic understanding and a simple pipeline example to get you started.

**CI/CD Pipelines in Azure DevOps:**

   - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   CI involves automatically building and testing your code every time a team member commits changes to version control. The key goals are to detect errors quickly and to improve software quality.

   - **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   CD extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a production environment after the build and test stages are successful. This ensures that the software is always in a releasable state.

**Components of a CI/CD Pipeline:**

  - **Source Control:** Where the code resides (e.g., Git repository).
  - **Build:** The process of compiling the source code into executable artifacts.
  - **Test:** Automated tests run to validate the code.
  - **Release:** Deploying the artifacts to staging or production environments.

### 1. Set up an Azure DevOps organization

     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   steps:
   - task: UsePythonVersion@0
     inputs:
       versionSpec: '3.x'
     displayName: 'Set up Python'

   - script: |
      echo "Building the HTML project..."
      mkdir output
      cp index.html output/

   - **Trigger**: Runs the pipeline when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
   - **Pool**: Uses an Ubuntu VM image for the build.
   - **Steps**:
   - Set up Python (although not used in this case, you might need it for other tasks).
   - Create a directory called `output` and copy `index.html` to it.
   - Publish the contents of `output` as build artifacts.
   
8. Click **Save and Run** then click **Save and Run** to start the Build Pipeline process.

## Task 3: Securing your pipeline with GHAS

To secure your pipeline with GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) and Microsoft Defender for DevOps, you can integrate these tools to enhance your pipeline's security posture. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use GHAS and Defender for DevOps for security:

### Enable Advanced Security from Portal

GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps includes extra permissions for more levels of control around Advanced Security results and management. Be sure to adjust individual permissions for your repository.

To ensure Azure DevOps Advanced Security is enabled in your organization, you can follow these steps:

1. Click **Project settings (1)** in the lower-left corner. In the left menu, under Repos, click **Repositories (2)**, then select the **eShopOnWeb (3)** repository.

   ![setup](images/06-26-2024(4).png)

1. Click on **Settings (1)**, then click on **Advanced Security (2)**, to turn it **On** and click **Enable all**.

    ![setup](images/06-26-2024(5).png)

1. Click **Begin Billing**.

    ![](images/lab1-image12.png)

1. Advanced Security and Push Protection are now enabled. You can also onboard Advanced Security at [Project-level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/security/configure-github-advanced-security-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#project-level-onboarding) and [Organization-level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/security/configure-github-advanced-security-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#organization-level-onboarding) as well, but we recommend for this hands-on lab to enable it only for repository level.
