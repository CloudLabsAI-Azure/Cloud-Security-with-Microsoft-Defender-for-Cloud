# Hands-on Labs - Day 1

## Cloud Security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

### Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you'll explore how to enhance cloud security using Microsoft Defender for Cloud by engaging with key protection scenarios. You'll start by getting familiar with Microsoft Defender for Cloudâ€™s capabilities, understanding how it helps assess and strengthen your security posture. Next, you'll secure Azure Storage by enabling threat protection, detecting unusual access patterns, and monitoring data exfiltration risks. You'll also learn how to protect SQL Servers running on Azure Virtual Machines by configuring advanced threat detection to identify vulnerabilities and malicious activities. Finally, you'll manage security policies to ensure consistent compliance across your Azure environment, tailoring security recommendations and controls to meet organizational standards.
